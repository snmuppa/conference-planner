Starting now, WebAssembly opens the floodgates to new choices, and one of the first realistic options may be .NET.\r\n\r\nBlazor is a new experimental web UI framework from the ASP.NET team that aims to brings .NET applications into all browsers (including mobile) via WebAssembly. It allows you to build true full-stack .NET applications, sharing code across server and client, with no need for transpilation or plugins.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’ll demonstrate what you can do with Blazor today and how it works on the underlying WebAssembly runtime behind the scenes. You’ll see its modern, component-based architecture (inspired by modern SPA frameworks) at work as we use it to build a responsive client-side UI. I’ll cover both basic and advanced scenarios using Blazor’s components, router, DI system, JavaScript interop, and more.",

That’s the reason why the IETF has published a number of so called “Best Current Practices” (BCPs) which update the original specs and threat models and give more prescriptive guidance.

How do you find them? And why does orienting a microservice around them make a difference.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will try to shed some light onto the black art of building a business capability map, and how you can use that to define the boundaries of your microservices. We will also look at ideas such as the Inverse Conway Manoeuvre and Products not Projects that enable greater agility and product velocity through the alignment of microservices and capabilities.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will look at how some technical concerns, such as integration can be soothed by better understanding how a capability map gives you more effective boundaries.",

Everything seems to be on fire and you need to stabilise the situation.\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore some techniques that are useful when working on systems that need a little love. At a high-level, we will go through approaching testing, monitoring, re-architecting and documenting these systems. We will also go through prioritisation when everything is urgent and the non-technical metrics that can help with buy-in for stabilising your system and team.\r\n\r\nThis talk is an intermediate level talk.

Identifying risks in code, architecture and products is helpful, dismissing ideas is not, especially as this behaviour can rapidly spread. What if the team becomes cynical? How can we break out of the cycle and actually start building software?\r\n\r\nIt’s very common for a team to pick up a piece of software and look at what has been written and decide, it’s simply trash. People believe that it can be built better. That the tools that the seemingly legacy software was built in have been superseded and the product is no longer fit for purpose. Cynicism for what is deemed as legacy but optimism for the brave new world.\r\n\r\nGwen will look at cynicism, scepticism, optimism and more as attitudes to building products, legacy and green field. She will identify some attitudes that help build, strong, long lasting products. If cynicism isn’t cool anymore, then what is?",

How they allow you to create solutions that are automatically load balanced, self-healing and even provides seamless rolling updates that allow you to release new versions with zero downtime. And knowing you, you probably want some of that too! \r\n\r\nHonestly though, it isn’t magic, and It won’t “just work”! It can seem pretty close to magic though, but as long as you understand how it works, you can use it to bring your applications hosting to the next level. With the operative words being “understand it”… Unless you know what you are doing, it can’t really help you…but that’s where this talk comes in!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will start out by looking at how you can set up your local development environment to run Kubernetes based applications. After that, we will look at the architectural building blocks that make up Kubernetes , and then go on to look at some of the great features that Kubernetes give you, and how you can take advantage of them in your projects.\r\n\r\nMost Kubernetes talks tend to focus on the DevOps side of things. And even if that’s where Kubernetes has the most impact, there are still quite a few things for us developers to understand before we can build applications that can be allowed in to the Kubernetes world.\r\n",

Shor's algorithm was formulated by Peter Shor in 1994. By using some fairly simple number theory, a bit of computationally complex (for a classical computer) modular exponentiation and some quantum magic, Shor's algorithm can efficiently factorise numbers. The quantum magic is weird, very weird. By using the Quantum Fourier Transform a quantum computer can exploit the interference pattern generated in parallel universes to discover the periodicity of modular exponentiation without actually calculating successive powers. So what can we do when RSA dies and what should we do now? BB84 is provably secure and also relies on quantum mechanics, specifically the polarisation of light photons. I will demonstrate BB84 as well as some classical algorithms that we can be using now that are quantum safe. The talk includes an explanation of how Shor works, a demonstration of an implementation of Shor using Q#, an explanation of BB84 and classical quantum safe algorithms and a lot of fun in the process.",

            "description": "We’ve seen significant benefits from choosing a microservice architecture for building enterprise applications, which allows us to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot in the usage of technologies. Mostly this architecture is then complemented by a feature-rich and powerful browser application which sits on top of these backend-services. Unfortunately, the latter step ends up way too often in the creation of a single, sprawling and hard to maintain frontend-monolith.\r\n\r\nThe approach of micro frontends is an effective way to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the underlying concepts of this architectural style, the idea of extending concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of fully end-to-end verticalized systems, and the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation become reasonable.\r\n\r\nUpon a closer look at the advantages and challenges I've experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job.",

Finally, we'll spend most of our time identifying subtle issues inherent to message processing, devising solutions to these issues and encoding these solutions in reusable patterns.\r\n\r\nJoin me in the series of ten hands-on exercises interleaved with short lectures after which you'll have good understanding of most of the things that can go wrong when processing messages and enough knowledge to either build build a bullet-and-duplicate-proof message processor or (even better) find a framework that implements one for you.\r\n\r\nSome of the topic we will cover include:\r\n- Handling message broker failures when receiving messages\r\n- Handling message broker failures when sending out messages\r\n- Handling data store failures and avoiding ghost messages\r\n- De-duplication based on message ID\r\n- Deterministic message ID generation\r\n- Deterministic message content generation\r\n- Atomic store-and-publish",

              "description": "In their description of microservices James Lewis and Martin Fowler noted that: “The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into services organized around business capability” But what is a business capability? How do you find them? And why does orienting a microservice around them make a difference.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will try to shed some light onto the black art of building a business capability map, and how you can use that to define the boundaries of your microservices. We will also look at ideas such as the Inverse Conway Manoeuvre and Products not Projects that enable greater agility and product velocity through the alignment of microservices and capabilities.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will look at how some technical concerns, such as integration can be soothed by better understanding how a capability map gives you more effective boundaries.",

In the meantime, the protocols have been attacked through known implementation weaknesses and anti-patterns, technology has changed and their usage has been expanded to use-cases and higher security environments than originally considered and anticipated. That’s the reason why the IETF has published a number of so called “Best Current Practices” (BCPs) which update the original specs and threat models and give more prescriptive guidance. This talk gives an overview over those BCPs and picks out a couple of the topics for more in-depth discussion.",

Everything seems to be on fire and you need to stabilise the situation.\r\n\r\nWe’ll explore some techniques that are useful when working on systems that need a little love. At a high-level, we will go through approaching testing, monitoring, re-architecting and documenting these systems. We will also go through prioritisation when everything is urgent and the non-technical metrics that can help with buy-in for stabilising your system and team.\r\n\r\nThis talk is an intermediate level talk. The aim is for you to not only learn how to deal with these situations but want to tackle the challenges they present and be excited about the change you can lead.\r\n",

Shor's algorithm was formulated by Peter Shor in 1994. By using some fairly simple number theory, a bit of computationally complex (for a classical computer) modular exponentiation and some quantum magic, Shor's algorithm can efficiently factorise numbers. The quantum magic is weird, very weird. By using the Quantum Fourier Transform a quantum computer can exploit the interference pattern generated in parallel universes to discover the periodicity of modular exponentiation without actually calculating successive powers. So what can we do when RSA dies and what should we do now? BB84 is provably secure and also relies on quantum mechanics, specifically the polarisation of light photons. I will demonstrate BB84 as well as some classical algorithms that we can be using now that are quantum safe. The talk includes an explanation of how Shor works, a demonstration of an implementation of Shor using Q#, an explanation of BB84 and classical quantum safe algorithms and a lot of fun in the process.",

Well, most people are roughly familiar with cats, their boundaries and their input/output mechanisms. It turns out it’s very easy to see when a use case has gone wrong when using a cat. We’ll take a look at some typical cat use cases and see what lessons we can take back software architecture.\r\n\r\nJoin me for an irreverent look at Coupling and Cohesion, Aggregate Roots and the Point of Highest Abstraction … all using the medium of cats.\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nTalk 3: Lean, not mean. Building sustainable software with Lean software practices - David James\r\n\r\nIn this session I will explain how some simple Lean Software Development principles can be used as high level markers to help drive up quality, sustainability, motivation and success in all software projects.\r\nBased originally on Lean manufacturing processes, Lean software development can help any team re-focus on whats important.\r\nI will work through the high level principles of Lean software development, explaining how they help and how they can be applied.\r\nThe goal of this session is to help software developers be able to identify practical ways in which they can improve their software development process.\r\nIt sounds dry, but its incredibly self-reflective and fun.\r\n",

With EVE being a single-shard universe known for it's huge battles, it is a big target for hackers who want to break into and steal player accounts for various purposes. I will show you what methods we have used to prevent and counter online attacks against our players, the challenges we've faced in doing so with minimal impact to user experience, where we've failed and succeeded and how we've had to constantly evolve in the process. By sharing our experiences and methods, we hope you can take advantage of them to increase the security of your own systems.",

As a software tester, a large part of my role is to be a skeptic but sometimes this crosses over to cynicism. Identifying risks in code, architecture and products is helpful, dismissing ideas is not, especially as this behaviour can rapidly spread. What if the team becomes cynical? How can we break out of the cycle and actually start building software?\r\n\r\nIt’s very common for a team to pick up a piece of software and look at what has been written and decide, it’s simply trash. People believe that it can be built better. That the tools that the seemingly legacy software was built in have been superseded and the product is no longer fit for purpose. Cynicism for what is deemed as legacy but optimism for the brave new world.\r\n\r\nGwen will look at cynicism, scepticism, optimism and more as attitudes to building products, legacy and green field. She will identify some attitudes that help build, strong, long lasting products. If cynicism isn’t cool anymore, then what is?",

Finally, we'll spend most of our time identifying subtle issues inherent to message processing, devising solutions to these issues and encoding these solutions in reusable patterns.\r\n\r\nJoin me in the series of ten hands-on exercises interleaved with short lectures after which you'll have good understanding of most of the things that can go wrong when processing messages and enough knowledge to either build build a bullet-and-duplicate-proof message processor or (even better) find a framework that implements one for you.\r\n\r\nSome of the topic we will cover include:\r\n- Handling message broker failures when receiving messages\r\n- Handling message broker failures when sending out messages\r\n- Handling data store failures and avoiding ghost messages\r\n- De-duplication based on message ID\r\n- Deterministic message ID generation\r\n- Deterministic message content generation\r\n- Atomic store-and-publish",

How they allow you to create solutions that are automatically load balanced, self-healing and even provides seamless rolling updates that allow you to release new versions with zero downtime. And knowing you, you probably want some of that too! \r\n\r\nHonestly though, it isn’t magic, and It won’t “just work”! It can seem pretty close to magic though, but as long as you understand how it works, you can use it to bring your applications hosting to the next level. With the operative words being “understand it”… Unless you know what you are doing, it can’t really help you…but that’s where this talk comes in!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will start out by looking at how you can set up your local development environment to run Kubernetes based applications. After that, we will look at the architectural building blocks that make up Kubernetes , and then go on to look at some of the great features that Kubernetes give you, and how you can take advantage of them in your projects.\r\n\r\nMost Kubernetes talks tend to focus on the DevOps side of things.

              "description": "We’ve seen significant benefits from choosing a microservice architecture for building enterprise applications, which allows us to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot in the usage of technologies. Mostly this architecture is then complemented by a feature-rich and powerful browser application which sits on top of these backend-services. Unfortunately, the latter step ends up way too often in the creation of a single, sprawling and hard to maintain frontend-monolith.\r\n\r\nThe approach of micro frontends is an effective way to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the underlying concepts of this architectural style, the idea of extending concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of fully end-to-end verticalized systems, and the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation become reasonable.\r\n\r\nUpon a closer look at the advantages and challenges I've experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job.",

That’s fine, but there’s no good reason to limit our industry to basically one language when so many powerful and mature alternate languages and programming platforms exist. Starting now, WebAssembly opens the floodgates to new choices, and one of the first realistic options may be .NET.\r\n\r\nBlazor is a new experimental web UI framework from the ASP.NET team that aims to brings .NET applications into all browsers (including mobile) via WebAssembly. It allows you to build true full-stack .NET applications, sharing code across server and client, with no need for transpilation or plugins.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’ll demonstrate what you can do with Blazor today and how it works on the underlying WebAssembly runtime behind the scenes. You’ll see its modern, component-based architecture (inspired by modern SPA frameworks) at work as we use it to build a responsive client-side UI. I’ll cover both basic and advanced scenarios using Blazor’s components, router, DI system, JavaScript interop, and more.",

Then there’s the code we all use every day to browse the web, watch movies, create spreadsheets… not quite so critical, but still code that solves problems and delivers services.\r\n\r\nBut what about the code that only exists because somebody wanted to write it? Code created just to make people smile, laugh, maybe even dance? Maybe even code that does nothing at all, created just to see if it was possible?\r\n\r\nJoin Dylan Beattie - programmer, musician, and creator of the Rockstar programming language - for an entertaining look at the art of code. We’ll look at the origins of programming as an art form, from Conway's Game of Life to the 1970s demoscene and the earliest Obfuscated C competitions. We’ll talk about esoteric languages and quines - how DO you create a program that prints its own source code? We’ll look at quine relays, code golf and generative art, and we’ll explore the phenomenon of live coding as performance - from the pioneers of electronic music to modern algoraves and live coding platforms like Sonic Pi.",

Our platform runs on an active-active geo-distributed infrastructure in multiple regions, on thousands of servers, petabyte scale storage and a global software defined network.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this global setup and scale brings unique challenges and opportunities. One of the transformations that we have been working on is migrating our 500 microservices to run on containers in Kubernetes. As we embarked on this journey we realized the need to improve upon not just our technology but also our processes. So we built an abstraction layer called blueprints to capture all metadata of our services and its dependencies in a well-defined, source-controlled, always up-to-date framework. This has enabled us to be more agile and in control while we are adapting to the Kubernetes ecosystem.",

A more comprehensive understanding of Application Security is needed. This talk with review the OWASP Top Ten 2017 and the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls 2018 and compare them to a more comprehensive standard: the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v4.0. OWASP's ASVS contains over 180 requirements that can provide a basis for defining what secure software really is. The OWASP ASVS can be used to help test technical security controls of web and API applications. It can also be used to provide developers with a list of requirements for secure development with much more nuance and detail than a top ten list! You cannot base a security program off a Top Ten list. You can base an Application Security program off of the OWASP ASVS.",

The lessons learned can be used on a side project, or in your day to day roles where applicable.\r\nI have distilled the most important lessons I have learnt over 5 years to create a useful guide for anyone looking to make the next step.\r\nThis talk includes .Net specific guidance. It includes recommendations for software and packages that we have used at Total Car Check to help you get a head start when trying to solve the common problems all e-businesses face, for example SEO (Search engine optimisation), avoiding the ‘snake oil’ and getting results.\r\nThis is the talk I wish I had heard before I started on my journey to build Total Car Check and I hope it can help inspire and assist others to build successful businesses.",

Now we try to follow security practices for protecting the deployed resources, too. This is a reason why DevSecOps is not hype anymore and is gaining more prominence. There is a lot of information about DevSecOps, but how to do it properly? Where to start? What are the best practices?\r\nIn this session, we will walk through an end-to-end scenario where we will deploy infrastructure components securely to Azure using Azure DevOps, Azure Container Registry and security tools. We will build a pipeline with security in mind to protect and detect potential security flows during the build.\r\nYou will learn:\r\n- How to build end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that builds the application and deploys infrastructure on Azure with security checks for the application, containers and infrastructure;\r\n- What are the security tools available for CI/CD pipeline and how to implement them in the best way into different Git workflows;\r\n- Best practices and patterns of building security pipelines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This session is packed with practical examples and demos of where the latest high-performance APIs and language features can be applied in your applications. \r\n\r\nDuring this session, we'll apply types such as Span and Memory to efficiently process data and to parse strings. We'll examine System.IO.Pipelines, offering high-performance I/O and we'll utilise ArrayPool to help reduce GC allocations. In .NET Core 3.0, we have new high-performance JSON APIs which we'll also add to our arsenal. Microsoft has made fantastic performance gains to the .NET Core framework; now it's time to apply them to your code!\r\n\r\nWe'll begin by discussing when and why performance matters in your applications. You'll learn how to measure your code, and use a data-driven approach to focus your optimisations.\r\n\r\nThese features can seem complicated, unapproachable and difficult to apply. In this session, Steve introduces high-performance newcomers to the features, showing you how they work, where they can be applied and how to measure performance improvements in your code.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for developers, who like Steve, are ready to begin their journey towards writing faster .NET code, which allocates less.

RxJS is a core part of the Angular framework used in everything from Reactive Forms to the HTTP module. Harnessing observables with Angular’s async pipe is essential to building clean and concise components.

But how to track logs when multiple calls are in place, clocks are skewed, network is faulty and something goes wrong? How to figure out what happened first? And how to debug this single request which caused so many troubles?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I explain problems with synchronizing clocks and why relying on timestamps doesn't work in the world of microservices. We will see happened-before relation, vector clocks, correlation ids and other patterns used to introduce some meaningful order. We will understand why common understanding of \"time\" is misleading in distributed systems and what to use to mitigate that.\r\n\r\nExamples will be in .NET.

            "description": "The “serverless” buzzword was popularized thanks to FaaS platforms (Function-as-a-Service). However, serverless goes beyond just functions. Even traditional Platform-as-a-Service solutions also exhibit serverless characteristics (managed infrastructure, auto-scaling capabilities, pay for usage), when they’re letting developers push their apps as the unit of deployment. Similarly, a container is just another way to package your business logic. And that’s what Google Cloud Run is all about: you package your code in a container. You decide to use any language, runtime or library, as long as it runs in a container that can receive incoming HTTP requests. Cloud Run is a fully-managed product that scales your container images from 0 to n depending on traffic, and you pay proportionally to that usage. It can also run in Google’s managed Kubernetes clusters (GKE) giving you more control on the machines running your workloads. Last but not least, you’re not tied to the Google Cloud Platform at all, as Cloud Run builds atop the Knative serverless building blocks for Kubernetes. You can also deploy and scale your containers on other cloud providers or on-premises, thanks to the openness and portability brought by Knative. After an overview of Cloud Run, its developer experience, we’ll go through various demos to watch your serverless containers in action!",

              "description": "Software and technology has changed every aspect of the world we live in. At one extreme are the ‘mission critical’ applications - the code that runs our banks, our hospitals, our airports and phone networks. Then there’s the code we all use every day to browse the web, watch movies, create spreadsheets… not quite so critical, but still code that solves problems and delivers services.\r\n\r\nBut what about the code that only exists because somebody wanted to write it? Code created just to make people smile, laugh, maybe even dance? Maybe even code that does nothing at all, created just to see if it was possible?\r\n\r\nJoin Dylan Beattie - programmer, musician, and creator of the Rockstar programming language - for an entertaining look at the art of code. We’ll look at the origins of programming as an art form, from Conway's Game of Life to the 1970s demoscene and the earliest Obfuscated C competitions. We’ll talk about esoteric languages and quines - how DO you create a program that prints its own source code? We’ll look at quine relays, code golf and generative art, and we’ll explore the phenomenon of live coding as performance - from the pioneers of electronic music to modern algoraves and live coding platforms like Sonic Pi.",

But in reality, the OWASP Top Ten (and other top ten lists) are just the bare minimum that at best provide entry-level general awareness. A more comprehensive understanding of Application Security is needed. This talk with review the OWASP Top Ten 2017 and the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls 2018 and compare them to a more comprehensive standard: the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) v4.0. OWASP's ASVS contains over 180 requirements that can provide a basis for defining what secure software really is. The OWASP ASVS can be used to help test technical security controls of web and API applications. It can also be used to provide developers with a list of requirements for secure development with much more nuance and detail than a top ten list! You cannot base a security program off a Top Ten list. You can base an Application Security program off of the OWASP ASVS.",

They support a standard machine life cycle. Predictive maintenance revolutionizes the future of machines. It tracks each of the machines’ unique life cycle and doesn’t generalize. It allows us to know if they need to be attended to in advance. This maintenance method provides information on upcoming, unknown or unpredicted critical failures. It creates an effective and innovative environment. Using data science to solve predictive maintenance revolutionizes the way we look at machines. It changes the data collection approach, enhances its quality and allows proper usage of the collected data.

But RxJS is efficient and expressive! We declare relationships between entities, describing the what not the how. The basic sequence operators, map, filter, and reduce, are probably familiar from using them in array chains. RxJS is a core part of the Angular framework used in everything from Reactive Forms to the HTTP module. Harnessing observables with Angular’s async pipe is essential to building clean and concise components. Developers can overcome the RxJS learning curve by focussing on core concepts like hot vs cold observables, piping operations, and a few of the most common operators.",

The largest improvements in performance can often be found through improving the underlying data.\r\n\r\nBad data is costing the US economy an estimated 3.1 trillion Dollars and approximately 27% of data is flawed in the world’s top companies. Bad data also contributes to the failure of many Data Science projects. Who can forget Tay.ai, Microsoft’s twitter-bot that learned to be genocidal when user’s tweets were not cleaned.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will discuss in what circumstances bad data can affect your project along with some high profile case studies. We will then spend as much time as we have to go through some of the techniques you will need to fix that bad data. This is aimed towards those with intermediate-level Data Science experience.",

Using .Net technologies I built the business from zero to checking millions of vehicles every month in a few years. Here I hope to share all of the shortcuts, tips, mistakes and must-do's for any project looking to go from side-project to money making business. This includes technology (opinions), cost control measures, strategies and things to avoid.\r\nI intend the lightening talk to be fun but informative. The lessons learned can be used on a side project, or in your day to day roles where applicable.\r\nI have distilled the most important lessons I have learnt over 5 years to create a useful guide for anyone looking to make the next step.\r\nThis talk includes .Net specific guidance. It includes recommendations for software and packages that we have used at Total Car Check to help you get a head start when trying to solve the common problems all e-businesses face, for example SEO (Search engine optimisation), avoiding the ‘snake oil’ and getting results.\r\nThis is the talk I wish I had heard before I started on my journey to build Total Car Check and I hope it can help inspire and assist others to build successful businesses.",

It's the ideal replacement for WCF or .NET Remoting, which are not supported on .NET Core.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll explore the different models that gRPC enables, from Request/Response to full bi-directional streaming, by building several small example applications demonstrating real-world usage. Participants can then use these applications as a reference for their own projects after the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will also cover running and consuming ASP.NET Core gRPC services in production on Docker or Kubernetes, complete with monitoring, logging and tracing.",

Our platform runs on an active-active geo-distributed infrastructure in multiple regions, on thousands of servers, petabyte scale storage and a global software defined network.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this global setup and scale brings unique challenges and opportunities. One of the transformations that we have been working on is migrating our 500 microservices to run on containers in Kubernetes. As we embarked on this journey we realized the need to improve upon not just our technology but also our processes. So we built an abstraction layer called blueprints to capture all metadata of our services and its dependencies in a well-defined, source-controlled, always up-to-date framework. This has enabled us to be more agile and in control while we are adapting to the Kubernetes ecosystem.",

Even traditional Platform-as-a-Service solutions also exhibit serverless characteristics (managed infrastructure, auto-scaling capabilities, pay for usage), when they’re letting developers push their apps as the unit of deployment. Similarly, a container is just another way to package your business logic. And that’s what Google Cloud Run is all about: you package your code in a container. You decide to use any language, runtime or library, as long as it runs in a container that can receive incoming HTTP requests. Cloud Run is a fully-managed product that scales your container images from 0 to n depending on traffic, and you pay proportionally to that usage. It can also run in Google’s managed Kubernetes clusters (GKE) giving you more control on the machines running your workloads. Last but not least, you’re not tied to the Google Cloud Platform at all, as Cloud Run builds atop the Knative serverless building blocks for Kubernetes. You can also deploy and scale your containers on other cloud providers or on-premises, thanks to the openness and portability brought by Knative. After an overview of Cloud Run, its developer experience, we’ll go through various demos to watch your serverless containers in action!",

We're collecting classes of data that have never been digitised before, storing it on the cloud and opening up control of devices to potentially anyone with an internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis talk delves into real world examples of how IoT fails us. It looks at what the vulnerabilities are, how they were exploited, the impact they're having and importantly, how we need to evolve as an industry to prevent future incidents.

Client-side frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular have their own processes and tools which do not easily align with tools in the ASP.NET stack.\r\n\r\nBut these tools CAN co-exist peacefully! In this presentation, we will walk through a File, New approach of creating a Single Page Application architecture that uses Vue.JS on the front end and ASP.NET Core on the backend.

You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck.

I'm thoroughly enjoying playing it (badly) but I've spent even more time talking to the kit over a USB MIDI connection, in an application which allows you to load, edit and save the drum kit configuration. Personal projects are always fertile grounds for learning and reflecting, unburdened by deadlines and other external forces.\r\n\r\nThis session will look at specific aspects of the (C#) code - particularly mutability and efficiency - but more importantly, we'll reflect together on the nature of personal projects and how we can use them to become more effective in our professional coding lives.\r\n\r\n(Drumming not included, for everyone's benefit.)",

The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you need to take into account?\r\n\r\nThese are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.",

            "description": "Mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) have disrupted the corporate enterprise network on the scale that PCs disrupted mainframes in the 1980s. Yet most enterprises continue to approach security as if though there is still a hard perimeter with nothing but corporate-owned end points running against internal applications. Mobility, however, means employee-owned end points connecting over public carrier networks to cloud applications. Traditional perimeter security simply doesn’t address this. From mobile-based phishing to Bluetooth-based attacks, mobile and IoT have fundamentally changed the threat landscape. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will look at the modern threat landscape, the security controls currently available on the market (such as mobile threat defense and mobile application management), and provide real world examples of how they fall short under simulated attack. Finally, we will look at practical ways to improve enterprise security around mobile and IoT as well as cause the defensive products to evolve to be more robust.\r\n\r\n",

As the volume of data increases and the number of sources where we gather our data also grows, the standard ETL processes we've used for the past several decades are starting to break down in terms of their effectiveness and timeliness.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll review the standard batch ETL processes most people are familiar with, and then we'll step into the world of streaming data where we'll start processing data in real-time leveraging Apache Kafka as the shared backbone for connecting our streaming data with SQL Server and ElasticSearch.  We'll be demonstrating real-time data aggregations and horizontal scaling using a combination of Kafka, Kafka Connect, KSQL and Kafka Streams.  \r\n\r\nIf you're curious what it might be like to live in a world where you're not waiting for your batch processes to complete and you'd rather have instant access to your processed data as it comes in, come join us in the evolution of ETL.",

Presented with such myriad options, how can we be confident of making an appropriate decision for the problem at hand? In search of guidance, developers often turn to online communities. This can exacerbate the problem as discussions about API styles often descend into statements about the superiority of one approach over another being presented as universal truths. Such comments invariably earn emotive rebuttals that also lack sufficient nuance. The result of such exchanges is increased confusion and uncertainty. Join me on a tour of these API styles where we will cut through this noise, demonstrate where each style shines (plus where they don't!) and ultimately resolve this dilemma of choice.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll take an in-depth look at API design; the best practices that have evolved; the game changing supporting technologies that are now available including HTTP/2; and most importantly what you need to do to deliver a world class developer experience:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of an API style for your application context. Don't be a victim of technology hype!\r\n- What is required to support graceful evolution of the API contract including the potential implications of both Hyrum's Law and the Law of Implicit Interfaces\r\n- Understand the supporting toolchains and technologies that dovetail with each API style.\r\n- The importance of treating your API as a product with an unwavering focus on improving the ease of consumption for your clients.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning these various API styles but also have the knowledge to put them into practice. If you want to take to your API design expertise to the next level, then this is the session for you. See you there!",

By creating custom reusable elements, teams are able to add a layer of indirection between the business logic and view layer of applications. This indirection lets legacy code and shiny, new frameworks work together in harmony.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn the current Web Components landscape and how to evaluate whether to use them for large legacy frontend migrations.

Receiving feedback is hard, and when we ask for help with it we just get more feedback. On top of that, your brain doesn't like feedback, and it has some sneaky tricks it uses to convince you to argue about, pick apart, or even outright ignore that feedback. But there's hope - you can fight your brain and win!\r\n\r\nThis workshop will use LEGO to help teach you the following: the types of feedback and when to use them; how to structure a feedback conversation for maximum benefit; what are the questions you should be asking at each step in the conversation; what a feedback trigger is and how to recognize, defuse, and redirect those triggers; and more! We’ll apply all this to both giving and receiving feedback. By the end of the workshop you should be able to face even the most brutal peer review with a straight face (though maybe not a smile). ",

We’ll start with building a web service using Saturn, a functional web framework which lets you write idiomatic F# web services running on top of ASP.NET Core. After that we’ll go onto build a web application running in the web browser, written in F# and compiled over to JavaScript with the Fable compiler. We’ll also then deploy it up into the cloud with Azure. You’ll end up having seen how easy it is to create end-to-end, standards compliant web applications written almost entirely in F# that play nicely with both .NET Core and the JavaScript worlds.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will expose you to all elements of the SAFE stack and the F# development ecosystem, allowing you to build full stack cloud ready web applications entirely in F#. You’ll get to see:\r\n\r\nWriting ASP .NET Core Web APIs with Saturn\r\nF# in the browser with Fable\r\nFunctional UI design with the Elmish architecture\r\nDeployment to the cloud with Azure\r\nIf you want to attend this workshop you’ll need a few things:\r\n\r\nA laptop running macOS, Linux or Windows\r\nAn F# editor such as VS Code with Ionide, Rider or VS2017/19\r\nA .NET core installation\r\nNode.js\r\nYarn\r\nIf you’re on macOS or Linux, you’ll also need Mono installed to run some of the tooling\r\nYou can read up on the pre-reqs here: https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/#install-pre-requisites",

              "description": "Mobility and the Internet of Things (IoT) have disrupted the corporate enterprise network on the scale that PCs disrupted mainframes in the 1980s. Yet most enterprises continue to approach security as if though there is still a hard perimeter with nothing but corporate-owned end points running against internal applications. Mobility, however, means employee-owned end points connecting over public carrier networks to cloud applications. Traditional perimeter security simply doesn’t address this. From mobile-based phishing to Bluetooth-based attacks, mobile and IoT have fundamentally changed the threat landscape. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will look at the modern threat landscape, the security controls currently available on the market (such as mobile threat defense and mobile application management), and provide real world examples of how they fall short under simulated attack. Finally, we will look at practical ways to improve enterprise security around mobile and IoT as well as cause the defensive products to evolve to be more robust.\r\n\r\n",

Should you burn it all to the ground and start over (who has the time for that?) or let it sit forever, getting more outdated each day? Is there a third way?\r\n\r\nWeb Components help bridge that gap between legacy and modern code without having to go to either extreme. By creating custom reusable elements, teams are able to add a layer of indirection between the business logic and view layer of applications. This indirection lets legacy code and shiny, new frameworks work together in harmony.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you’ll learn the current Web Components landscape and how to evaluate whether to use them for large legacy frontend migrations. You’ll also learn how to overcome architectural challenges of large scale refactoring by looking at a common use of Web Components: using Angular Elements to iteratively migrate AngularJS (1.x) to Angular (2+).",

The shift towards an API landscape indicates a significant evolution in the way we build applications. The rise of JavaScript and mobile applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you need to take into account?\r\n\r\nThese are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.",

But as soon as you want to scale to 1000000 or more devices, you’re going to need a better strategy.\r\n\r\nScaling software is always tricky. We all have been through this. You load balance your web farm only to find out that your database is a bottleneck. Or to find out you need to synchronize caches across your farm, etc. Akka.NET and its implementation of the actor model make scaling a bit easier.  Developing stateful code becomes a breeze, as well as scaling it and making it resilient. But there are pitfalls as well. \r\n\r\nNo prior Akka.NET knowledge is required.\r\n",

But beware - all the algorithms have some cases when they fail to deliver what you're expecting. This talk is packed with live demos that show failure cases of popular algorithms, from linear regression to cutting-edge deep learning. We will look at practical examples, use standard algorithms without tuning and observe when they fail and why.

We need to be able to break this cycle from throwing us into a spiral of distraction while still being able to enjoy all these innovations.\r\n\u2028\r\nWhen I first went self-employed, I thought I had the ultimate freedom to do what I wanted, when I wanted. To a degree, I did, but I didn’t have anyone looking over me, holding me to account. I started to become distracted. After I while, I decided things had to change. I started on a quest to become more productive, focused, and increase my motivation; while still enjoy the occasional Netflix binge.\r\n\u2028\r\nIn this talk, I want to share my story of personal distraction, low motivation, and increased project anxiety.

On top of that, your brain doesn't like feedback, and it has some sneaky tricks it uses to convince you to argue about, pick apart, or even outright ignore that feedback. But there's hope - you can fight your brain and win!\r\n\r\nThis workshop will use LEGO to help teach you the following: the types of feedback and when to use them; how to structure a feedback conversation for maximum benefit; what are the questions you should be asking at each step in the conversation; what a feedback trigger is and how to recognize, defuse, and redirect those triggers; and more! We’ll apply all this to both giving and receiving feedback. By the end of the workshop you should be able to face even the most brutal peer review with a straight face (though maybe not a smile). ",

You’ll learn what types of biases to watch out for, how to challenge your own assumptions, how to engage hard-to-reach audiences, and how the user-driven insights we gained uncovered the struggles unique to their community and informed our design decisions and product iterations.

We will then explore the important principles and challenges in designing this kind of solution.

We’ll start with building a web service using Saturn, a functional web framework which lets you write idiomatic F# web services running on top of ASP.NET Core. After that we’ll go onto build a web application running in the web browser, written in F# and compiled over to JavaScript with the Fable compiler. We’ll also then deploy it up into the cloud with Azure. You’ll end up having seen how easy it is to create end-to-end, standards compliant web applications written almost entirely in F# that play nicely with both .NET Core and the JavaScript worlds.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will expose you to all elements of the SAFE stack and the F# development ecosystem, allowing you to build full stack cloud ready web applications entirely in F#. You’ll get to see:\r\n\r\nWriting ASP .NET Core Web APIs with Saturn\r\nF# in the browser with Fable\r\nFunctional UI design with the Elmish architecture\r\nDeployment to the cloud with Azure\r\nIf you want to attend this workshop you’ll need a few things:\r\n\r\nA laptop running macOS, Linux or Windows\r\nAn F# editor such as VS Code with Ionide, Rider or VS2017/19\r\nA .NET core installation\r\nNode.js\r\nYarn\r\nIf you’re on macOS or Linux, you’ll also need Mono installed to run some of the tooling\r\nYou can read up on the pre-reqs here: https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/#install-pre-requisites",

              "description": "GraphQL, gRPC, REST and WebHooks are among a bewildering array of technologies and architectural styles that are available to API developers today. Presented with such myriad options, how can we be confident of making an appropriate decision for the problem at hand? In search of guidance, developers often turn to online communities. This can exacerbate the problem as discussions about API styles often descend into statements about the superiority of one approach over another being presented as universal truths. Such comments invariably earn emotive rebuttals that also lack sufficient nuance. The result of such exchanges is increased confusion and uncertainty. Join me on a tour of these API styles where we will cut through this noise, demonstrate where each style shines (plus where they don't!) and ultimately resolve this dilemma of choice.\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll take an in-depth look at API design; the best practices that have evolved; the game changing supporting technologies that are now available including HTTP/2; and most importantly what you need to do to deliver a world class developer experience:\r\n\r\n- How to determine the suitability of an API style for your application context. Don't be a victim of technology hype!\r\n- What is required to support graceful evolution of the API contract including the potential implications of both Hyrum's Law and the Law of Implicit Interfaces\r\n- Understand the supporting toolchains and technologies that dovetail with each API style.\r\n- The importance of treating your API as a product with an unwavering focus on improving the ease of consumption for your clients.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you will not only understand the concepts underpinning these various API styles but also have the knowledge to put them into practice. If you want to take to your API design expertise to the next level, then this is the session for you. See you there!",

Yet, it also has other great uses in classically object-oriented languages such as C#. Immutability can help make your code cleaner, easier to reason about, and reduce runtime errors.  But how can you do that without making it feel like you're fighting against the typically-mutable C# and the entire .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nIn this session, Spencer will discuss immutability and how you can apply it in your day-to-day as a .NET/C# developer.  We'll go over immutable objects, immutable collections, and how you can refactor your code to successfully apply immutability to your exisitng codebase.  Spencer will also discuss the implications of introducing immutability to your code, both positive and negative.",
